              <p>
                  An application that has a basic HTML file calls one or more Javascript files,
                  which creates and loads all of my HTML into the site by injecting it into the document object model dynamically. 
                  All this happens on the client side. <br> <br>
                  Client CPU does all the processing and most computers should be able to handle it. 
                  It takes longer for a client to make a request and get a response from an API than a server if we were to request API data.

              </h3>
              <p>
                  Server-side rendering used to be the conventional method for getting your HTML data up onto your screen. 
                  The server will access all the required data and run the Javascript file, create the page and send it back to the client. <br> <br>
                  Benefits of Server-side rendering involves advantages such as speed, because a server works much faster than a clients computer and 
                  better connection to the internet so the API can reply faster. <br> <br>

                  With either rendering approach, you'll get a fully rendered HTML document.
